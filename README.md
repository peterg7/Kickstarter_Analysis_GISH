Based on the analysis, there are a couple of factors that have been identified as being correlated to a campaign's chance of success. Focusing on campaigns falling into the category of "theater", the subcategory of "plays" is historically the most successful. The campaigns launched between May and June also show higher success rates. The projects that lasted between 21-30 days are also the most likely to be successful based on this 2015 Kickstarter data. With all of these identified factors, there would be the highest chance of success for a theatrical campaign if it is in the subcategory of "plays", launches in May/June, and is live for 21-30 days.
