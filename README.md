Based on the analysis, there are multiple factors that have been identified as being correlated to a campaign's chance of success. When looking at campaigns falling into the category of "theater" out of the 3 subcategories "plays" is historically the most successful demonstrating the importance of how the campaign is listed. Projects launched between May and June showed higher success rates compared to projects launched in any other month. This highlights the importance of launch timing when considering starting a campaign on Kickstarter. The projects that lasted between 21-30 days are also the most likely to be successful based on this 2015 Kickstarter data compared to those spanning longer or shorter time periods. Therefore, there seems to be a "sweet spot" for the duration of a compaign.  
With all of these identified factors, there would be the highest chance of success for a theatrical campaign if it is in the subcategory of "plays", launches in May/June, and is live for 21-30 days.
